# BART Summarization

This is an example explaining entire pipe line for a summarization task using pymarlin library.

[Source code location](https://github.com/microsoft/PyMarlin/tree/main/examples/bart).

Dataset used: CNN Daily mail
Model : [BART] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461)


We start with a pretrained checkpoint from huggingface and finetune on CNN dailymail data.

Before training (1000 val steps)
    python train.py --config_path config-prod.yaml --data_path ../cnn_cln --dist False --tmgr.disable_tqdm False --gpu_batch_size_limit 32 [--tmgr.max_val_steps_per_epoch 1000]

After Training:

Samples:

True summaries:

['A man in suburban Boston is selling snow online to customers in warmer states . For $89, he will ship 6 pounds of snow in an insulated Styrofoam box .', 
'The 20th MLS season begins this weekend . League has changed dramatically since its inception in 1996 . Some question whether rules regarding salary caps and transfers need to change .', 
'Bafetimbi Gomis collapses within 10 minutes of kickoff at Tottenham . But he reportedly left the pitch conscious and wearing an oxygen mask . Gomis later said that he was "feeling well" The incident came three years after Fabrice Muamba collapsed at White Hart Lane .', 
'Ruben Navarrette: Schilling deserves praise for taking on online haters for offensive comments about his daughter . Navarrette: In protecting his child, Schilling set a model for parenting and taught us a lesson about social media .', 
'Rory McIlroy throws club into water at WGC Cadillac Championship . Northern Irishman frustrated after pulling shot into water hazard .']

Predicted Summaries:
['Self-styled entrepreneur Kyle Waring is selling snow in insulated Styrofoam', 
'The MLS is set to mark the beginning of its 20th season . Attendances have', 
"French striker Bafetimbi Gomis collapses during Swansea's 3-2", 
'Gabby Schilling, 17, was harassed by a group of Twitter trolls . Sch', 
'Rory McIlroy pulls his second shot on the eighth hole of the WGC']


Clearly the target summaries are longer than the predictions, but the summaries are of very high quality. With some parameter changes to decoding beam search, ROUGE scores can be improved. 


Now let's add these params to our config file and pass them to the generate function of BART.
    generate:
        max_length: 128
        do_sample : False
        num_beams : 5

His website and social media accounts claim to have filled more than 133 orders for snow .', 'The MLS is set to mark the beginning of its 20th season . Attendances are higher than ever before while the number of teams involved has doubled . The new season is the first of a new domestic TV and media rights deal with FOX, ESPN and Univision worth $700 million over eight years .', 'French striker Bafetimbi Gomis collapses during Swansea\'s 3-2 loss at Tottenham . The 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment . Swansea manager Garry Monk says he is now "feeling well"', "Curt Schilling is the father of the year for his daughter Gabby Schilling . Schilling's daughter, 17, was sent a tweet congratulating her on being accepted to Salve Regina University . The tweets quickly went from immature, to creepy, to repugnant, Schilling says . He says social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others allow sharing of information .", 'Rory McIlroy pulls his second shot on the eighth hole of the WGC Cadillac Championship into a lake . The four-time major winner launched the 3-iron used to play the offending shot into the water . The Northern Irishman composed himself to finish with a second round of 70, leaving him one-under for the tournament .']

The intuition works! The results are closer to paper results. Leaving it to the users to tune further hyper parameters.

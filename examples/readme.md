# Examples

A collection of examples of PyMarlin in action!

1. Classification on Kaggle `covid19-nlp-text-classification` with BERT
2. Summarization on `CNN/DailyMail` with BART (and optionally ORT+DeepSpeed extensions)
3. GLUE classification tasks with RoBERTa

In addition the `azureml` dir contains a script to submit the classification example as an E2E test.
